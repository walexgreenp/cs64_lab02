# cs64_lab02
Lab 02 for UCSB cs64.

# What I learned
* Learned how to use li, add, sub, xor, move, and syscall operations on MIPS Assembly.
* Understood registers and usage for each.
* Performed bitwise operations using xor on 2 sets of bits.

# How to use
To run program, write ```make``` into terminal. Outputs the value 27. <br />
(Does following operations: [ ($t2 + $t1 - $t0) XOR ($t2 - $t1) ]. Stores this value into $t3 and prints.)
